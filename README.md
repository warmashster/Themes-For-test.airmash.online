# Themesofairmashandzoom
This is only if you play on starmash for your theme graphic. Update any theme graphics on starmash an easy way. AirMash does not support modding out of the box right now, so, the easiest way I can think of, right now, is to download a Chrome extension called Requestly Rules

This extension lets you change some things done by your browser when you are loading a page. In this case, we will use it to change the files used by the game.


The Steps:

Install Requestly in your browser:
Chrome users
Firefox users
Once installed, it will show as a blue r icon, next to your address bar.
Download the configuration file from this link to a local folder.
Click the r button, and the configuration page for Requestly will open.
Choose the blue button (Upload), and select the file you downloaded, “requestly_rules.txt”.
You can now close this tab.
Go to airma.sh and hit CTRL+F5 ( Mac users: Hold down both ⌘ Cmd+⇧ Shift and press R)
Enjoy!
