# Themesofairmash
Hi! Welcome

This is only for if You use [Starma.sh](https://starma.sh/)  for the Theme graphics, and if you quit [Starma.sh](https://starma.sh/) because of lag lately, but admired the graphic of the Theme, and if You use test.airmash.online.

# **HOW TO USE THESE FILES?**

Easy! Just follow these simple steps, and you will be done faster than reading this paragraph!

AirMash does not support modding out of the box right now, so, the easiest way I can think of,  right now, is to download a Chrome extension called [Requestly](https://www.requestly.in/home/)..

This extension lets you change some things done by your browser when you are loading a page. In this case, we will use it to change the files used by the game.

The Steps:

1. Install Requestly in your browser: 
    - [Chrome users](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa)
    - [Firefox users](https://www.requestly.in/firefox/builds/requestly-latest.xpi)
    - Once installed, it will show as a blue `r` icon, next to your address bar.
2. I recommend you watch the full video and do the same steps i did for the other theme files.  
3. Click the `r` button, and the configuration page for Requestly will open.
4. Choose the blue button (Upload), and select the file you downloaded, "requestly_rules.txt".
5. Go to [airma.sh](https://test.airmash.online/) and hit `CTRL+F5` ( Mac users: Hold down both `⌘ Cmd`+`⇧ Shift` and press `R`)
6. How to Download the type of theme file you want Chrome users [from this link](https://youtu.be/yirtFUMG6ZQ). 
7. Enjoy!

# How many of these files can you use?
If you download two Theme (or more) you can upload both (Or more) file (s) theme in requestly rules. You have to leave only one on and turn the other ones off.
# Why can't I edit [Airmash](https://test.airmash.online/)(Missile, Upgs) and also [Airmash](https://test.airmash.online/) Particles?
I can't edit [Airmash](https://test.airmash.online/) items lately because there has been a new Upgrade box and a New Missile (Carrot).
I can't edit airmash Particles because Requestly rules does not allow me, if you try it's not gonna work.
