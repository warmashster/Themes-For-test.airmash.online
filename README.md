Hi! Welcome
# **HOW TO USE THESE FILES?**

Easy! Just follow these simple steps, and you will be done faster than reading this paragraph!

AirMash does not support modding out of the box right now, so, the easiest way I can think of,  right now, is to download a Chrome extension called [Requestly](https://www.requestly.in/home/)..

This extension lets you change some things done by your browser when you are loading a page. In this case, we will use it to change the files used by the game.

The Steps:

1. Install Requestly in your browser: 
    - [Chrome users](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/requestly/mdnleldcmiljblolnjhpnblkcekpdkpa)
    - [Firefox users](https://www.requestly.in/firefox/builds/requestly-latest.xpi)
    - Once installed, it will show as a blue `r` icon, next to your address bar.
2. Download the configuration file [from this link](https://molesmalo.github.io/StarWarsMod4AirMash/redirect_rules/requestly_rules.txt) to a local folder.
3. Click the `r` button, and the configuration page for Requestly will open.
4. Choose the blue button (Upload), and select the file you downloaded, "requestly_rules.txt".
5. You can now close this tab.
6. Go to [airma.sh](https://airma.sh) and hit `CTRL+F5` ( Mac users: Hold down both `⌘ Cmd`+`⇧ Shift` and press `R`)
7. Enjoy!
